# ClientesNoBar

The program illustrates with a simple animation the control of threads with semaphores logic. The situation here is similar to the readers-writers problem. 
Here the costumers try to enter the bar and take a chair, the chair is the limited resource, once the bar is full, nobody can enter the bar even if one costumer leaves. 
New costumers can only enter the bar when it's empty.
